## Building Instructions

1. ./configure --with-pydebug
2. make -j2

After each step, run `git status` to make sure that no files were added or modified. If necessary, add to the .gitignore to make sure that you will not be committing anything to the repo that is specific to your machine.


## To use

Do not commit anything to the master branch. If you are going to make any changes make a branch and commit changes to that.
